		<span class="section-title" style="background-color: red">Dan Dan Noodle</span>
		<p>Funny name, serious flavor. You've got to be sure to take the time to mix the sauce in well with the noodles as it tends to pool a bit on the bottom. Szechuan specialty Dan Dan Noodles are so popular. Its crispy, spicy & numbing peppercorn inspired the flavor to the next level.</p></div>
	<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
		<span class="section-title cold">Cold Noodle w/ Szechuan Sauce</span>
		<p>Another Szechuan treasure. This is it, this is the noodle we have eaten our weight in at this point. Ordering at least 4 every time! Tangy cold noodles mixed with veggies and spices. Vegetarian options are available.</p></div>
	<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12 col-sm-12">
		<span class="section-title beef">Spicy Beef Sandwich</span>
		<p>A definite treat. There's something to be said about the simplicity of an oily, spicy, delicious slice of beef. Freshly steamed buns with well-seasoned beef, lettuce, cucumber, and a hint of spicy/pancake sauce.</p></div>
